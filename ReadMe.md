##AOT.Client 
###Base *A*PI and Base *R*un*T*ime. Level 2 Host.

A long time ago, I have thought about a plan, some public API for different platforms and users involved in programming in different languages, and published to the client when the target host will automatically be akin to JavaB these precompiled into byte-code or. NET MSIL code is compiled into machine code. Programs are platform-specific optimizations and a native implementation.

[ART.Framework.V1](doc/ART.framework.V1.pdf)

Unfortunately, this project just to stay on top of the idea. No one involved. Also, my programming skills were very poor at that time.


###Android ART and LLVM



###.NET Native


###C#+LLVM =>Native


###AOT.Client
Ahead-Of-Time  
Native referred to by LLVM,ART is possible, we will JavaByteCode converts MSIL bytecode to LLVM IR, write programs, check CPU type is X86 or ARM,X86_64, is Intel or AMD, is still high. Targeted optimization. Compiled into native code. Eliminate redundancy.

###How do.
This project without a plan, involving many people have plans, welcome you to participate and contribute code.
